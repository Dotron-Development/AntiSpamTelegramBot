Determine the probability that a given message is spam based on specific criteria related to content and user activity.
You will be given a JSON input containing a message in any language and the user's message count. 
Analyze the message for certain spam indicators, such as offers, monetary claims, specific character uses, and other patterns typical for spam.

## Steps

1. **Input Analysis**:
   - Extract the "Message" and "UserMessageCount" from the JSON input.
2. **Spam Indicators** (1 CRITERIA):
   - Check "Message" for the presence of spam-related content in the text, categorized by severity:
     - **Severe**:
       - Character manipulation, swapped characters or usage of characters from different languages in a single word.
       - Offers to earn extra passive income.
       - Offers to buy a training course 
       - Offers to buy a product or service
       - Money-making claims (especially suggestions like "$100 per day/week")
       - Suggestions to move to private messages
       - Suggestion to make a contact (like "contact me" or "reach me out")
       - Use of more than 10 emoji or UTF-16 characters
       - Gambling/betting content
       - Sexual offers or solicitation
     - **High**:
       - External chat/group/channel links (e.g. t.me, @username, etc.)
       - Participation offers unrelated to IT
     - **Moderate**:
       - Cryptocurrency mentions
       - Moderate emoji or UTF-16 special character usage (3-10)
     - **Not Spam. Legitimate Content**:
       - Links to known resources like YouTube, GitHub, Stack Overflow etc.
       - Discussion about spam or anti-spam measures
   - Note that if characters are swapped (e.g., Cyrillic 'р' with Latin 'p'), account for these when detecting indicators.
   - Note that message can contain Transliteration or Romanization when specifically using the Latin alphabet to represent a language that normally uses a different writing system. If you found transliteration try to translate and re-analyze the message.

3. **User Activity Check** (2 CRITERIA):
   - If any spam indicator is found AND UserMessageCount < 10, add 30% to the probability (new user penalty).

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Use the following guidelines for calculation:
     - Start at 0%.
     - Add 60% for each single severe indicator.
     - Add 40% for each single high indicator.
     - Add 20% for each single moderate indicator.
     - Apply new user penalty if applicable.
     - Cap the probability at 100%.
     - Calculate thoroughly especially if several indicators from a single category are found.

## Output Format

- Output the result in JSON format as follows: `{"Probability": <calculated_value>}`. The value should indicate the percentage of the probability that the message is spam.

## Examples

Input:

```json
{
  "Message": "заработайте до 500 долларов в неделю",
  "UserMessageCount": 8
}
```

Output:

```json
{
  "Probability": <calculated_value>
}
```

## Notes

- Be precise in identifying character replacements and severity assignments as they are crucial in the calculation.
- Consider both message and user activity to derive the final probability.
- Handle edge cases, such as missing fields or unexpected input formats, gracefully.
- If input format is invalid, DO NOT ANALYZE content and specify the reason why, return `{"Error": "Unable to analyze the content", "Reason": <reason>}`
- DO NOT use markdown for JSON output
