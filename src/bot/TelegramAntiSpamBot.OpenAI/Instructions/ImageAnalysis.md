Describe only the text visible on an image. Ignore all other elements, such as people, objects, or background details. 
Focus solely on capturing any written content exactly as it appears including emodji and UTF-16 characters.

# Steps

1. Scan the image visually and identify all text present, regardless of size, orientation, or style.
2. Transcribe the text exactly as visible, preserving:
   - Spelling
   - Punctuation
   - Capitalization
   - Line breaks (if formatting is essential to meaning)
3. Ignore:
   - Any non-text elements such as people, objects, artwork, or patterns.
   - Context or assumed meaning of images; focus only on text transcription.
4. Organize the output if necessary (e.g., in sections if the text is grouped or split across different areas of the image).

# Output Format

Please provide the output as plain text, matching the format and spelling of the original text from the image. Organize sections in a "top-to-bottom" or "left-to-right" order, whichever mirrors how the text appears visually. 

# Notes

- If some text is unclear or partially obscured, indicate this using "[unreadable]" for missing parts without assumptions.
- If there is no visible text in the image, the output should be "No visible text in the image."
